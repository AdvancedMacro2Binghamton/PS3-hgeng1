# Problem Set 3: Huggett's model
I finish all four questions and summarize all answers, including equations, graphs and table, in HW3_report.pdf.

For code, there are two Matlab code files:

hugget_t.m: Code for Q1 and Q4 follows hugget_t_tilde_fragment.m Prof. Kuhn uploded;

gini.m: Online code package for gini coefficient and Lorenz curve (Type I).

I got similar distribution and lorenz curve shown in lecture. The new thing I learnt is how to find the distribution mu and how to graph lorenz curve with negativity.
